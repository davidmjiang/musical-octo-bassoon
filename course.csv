This course explores various topics within computer science through the lens of cultural heritage: data visualization, human-AI interaction, search &amp; discovery, crowdsourcing, web archiving, design &amp; UX, and classification. The goals of this course are two-fold: first, to survey these topics in computer science, and second, to explore how they manifest within the context of cultural heritage. We will cover one topic every week, with the first meeting devoted to the CS-oriented literature for the topic, and the second meeting devoted to the sociotechnical implications of the topic in practice. During these second meetings, we will speak with cultural heritage practitioners at institutions across the country to learn about the roles of computing in their work, research, and stewardship.This seminar is accessible to those without any formal training in computer science.
